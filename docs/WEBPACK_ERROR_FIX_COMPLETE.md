# WEBPACK ERROR FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Error Fixed: âœ…
```
TypeError: __webpack_require__.nmd is not a function
```

## Root Cause:
This error occurs when Next.js webpack cache becomes corrupted, often due to:
- Build cache conflicts
- File system permission issues  
- Rapid file changes during development

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Cleared Build Cache âœ…
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
```

### 2. Cleared npm Cache âœ…  
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

### 3. Restarted Development Server âœ…
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Server Status:
- **New Port**: http://localhost:3002 (was 3001)
- **Status**: âœ… Running cleanly without webpack errors
- **API**: âœ… Responding properly (GET /api/votes 200 OK)

## Prevention Tools Created:

### PowerShell Script: `fix-webpack-cache.ps1`
Run this anytime you encounter webpack issues:
```powershell
.\fix-webpack-cache.ps1
```

### Batch Script: `fix-webpack-cache.bat`  
Alternative for Windows command prompt:
```cmd
fix-webpack-cache.bat
```

## When to Use:
- Server fails to start with webpack errors
- "nmd is not a function" errors
- Build cache corruption
- After major file changes

## Current Status:
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - Development server running cleanly on port 3002

The webpack error has been completely fixed and the betting system should now work properly!
