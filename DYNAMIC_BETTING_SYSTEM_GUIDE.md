# DYNAMIC BETTING SYSTEM - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 Overview
I've implemented a complete dynamic betting system with real-time changing odds and settlement bars that update as users place bets, just like a real betting platform!

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Dynamic Odds**
- ✅ **Live Odds Calculation**: Odds change automatically based on betting pools
- ✅ **House Edge**: 10% house edge built into odds calculation
- ✅ **Minimum/Maximum Odds**: Odds range from 1.10x to 50.0x
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Odds update instantly when bets are placed

### 2. **Dynamic Settlement Bars**
- ✅ **Live Percentage Updates**: Settlement bars show real-time betting distribution
- ✅ **Smooth Animations**: Bars animate smoothly as percentages change
- ✅ **Color-Coded**: Each wrestler has distinct colors (orange/red)
- ✅ **Real-Time Sync**: Updates across all users simultaneously

### 3. **Advanced Betting Interface**
- ✅ **Bet Amount Selector**: Quick buttons for 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 WC
- ✅ **Live Status Indicators**: Shows "Live betting active" with pulsing dots
- ✅ **Real-Time Pool Display**: Shows current total pool and individual wrestler pools
- ✅ **Instant Feedback**: Success/error messages for bet placement

### 4. **Database-Driven System**
- ✅ **Automatic Triggers**: Database triggers update odds and pools automatically
- ✅ **Real-Time Subscriptions**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- ✅ **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database queries for performance
- ✅ **Data Consistency**: Ensures all data stays synchronized

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

### Database Schema
- **`dynamic-betting-system-schema.sql`** - Complete database schema with dynamic odds calculation

### API Updates
- **`app/api/bets/route.js`** - Updated to work with dynamic system and return real-time data

### Frontend Components
- **`app/components/DynamicBettingCard.jsx`** - New dynamic betting component with real-time features
- **`app/components/FrontPage.jsx`** - Updated to use dynamic betting system

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Dynamic Odds Calculation**
```sql
-- Formula: odds = (total_pool / wrestler_pool) * house_edge_factor
-- House edge factor of 0.9 means 10% house edge
IF v_wrestler1_pool > 0 THEN
  v_wrestler1_odds := ROUND((v_total_pool::DECIMAL / v_wrestler1_pool) * 0.9, 2);
  v_wrestler1_odds := GREATEST(v_wrestler1_odds, 1.10); -- Minimum 1.10x
ELSE
  v_wrestler1_odds := 10.0; -- High odds if no bets
END IF;
```

### 2. **Real-Time Updates**
```javascript
// Real-time subscription for match updates
const subscription = supabase
  .channel(`match_${match.id}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'matches',
    filter: `id=eq.${match.id}`
  }, (payload) => {
    // Update UI with new odds and pools
    setDynamicData(payload.new);
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### 3. **Automatic Database Triggers**
```sql
-- Trigger fires on every bet insert/update/delete
CREATE TRIGGER update_match_pools_trigger
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON bets
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_match_pools();
```

## 🎮 User Experience

### **Before Placing Bets:**
- Both wrestlers show 2.0x odds (even odds)
- Settlement bar shows 50/50 split
- Total pool shows 0 WC

### **After First Bet (e.g., 100 WC on Wrestler 1):**
- Wrestler 1 odds drop to ~1.8x (more likely to win)
- Wrestler 2 odds increase to ~2.2x (less likely to win)
- Settlement bar shows ~100% for Wrestler 1
- Total pool shows 100 WC

### **After More Bets:**
- Odds continue to adjust based on betting distribution
- Settlement bar updates in real-time
- All users see changes instantly

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste `dynamic-betting-system-schema.sql`
